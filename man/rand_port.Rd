\title{Generates N random portfolios based on an asset universe}
\usage{
rand_port(data, N = 50, K = 1, weights = "equal",
  return_ec = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An xts matrix of periodic returns (NOT prices).  These
may be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly returns.}

\item{N}{The number of random portfolios to generate}

\item{K}{The number of asset returns randomly picked (without replacement)
at each time period to build each random strategy equity curve.}

\item{weights}{Specifies how the asset weights will be assigned in each random
portfolio. Set to "equal" to specify equal weighting.  Set to
"uniform" to specify a uniform random distribution for each asset.
Set to "average" to calculate the equal weight, daily rebalance
equity curve (very fast).  By the Central Limit Theorem, all
equity curves should be identical.  However, statistics are not
available when set to "average" (return NAs).}

\item{return_ec}{Logical.  If set to TRUE, all randomly generated equity curves
are returned via an object $ec in the returned list. Otherwise,
only the average equity curve is returned in $ec, named 'ecavg'.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of statistics and matrices related to the random portfolios generated
          as follows:
\describe{
  \item{\preformatted{$cagr, $mdd, $mar:}}{
    Each of these is a numeric vector containing the following statistics for the performance metric:
    CAGR (the annualized return), the Maximum Drawdown (MDD) and the MAR ratio (CAGR / MDD).
    \itemize{
       \item
       \strong{mean     } The average (mean) CAGR over the distribution of portfolios.
       \item
       \strong{SD       } The standard deviation of CAGRs over the distribution of portfolios.
       \item
       \strong{skewness } The skewness of CAGRs over the distribution of portfolios.
       \item
       \strong{kurtosis } The kurtosis of CAGRs over the distribution of portfolios.
       \item
       \strong{quantiles} The next three items are, respectively:  First Quartile,
                          Median and Thrid Quartile.
    }
  }

  \item{\preformatted{$ec }}{
    An xts matrix containing the average equity curve of all random portfolio, named ecavg, if
    return_ec = FALSE.  If return_ec = TRUE, then all random portfolio equity curves are included,
    in addition to ecavg.
    }

  \item{\preformatted{$cagr_dist, $mdd_dist, $mar_dist: }}{
    Each of these is a named numeric vector containing the value of their statistic for each
    equity curve.  These are useful to visualize the distribution of the statistic.
    }

}
}
\description{
This function is slow for 1000 random portfolios.  May need to look at Rcpp
since bytecode compilation doesn't seem to help, and neither using lapply to
get rid of the for loop.
